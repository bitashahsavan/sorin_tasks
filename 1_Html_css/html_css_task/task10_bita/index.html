                    <h2>what is c++</h2>
                        C++ is a general-purpose programming language that was developed as an enhancement
                        of the C language to include object-oriented paradigm.
                        It is an imperative and a compiled language. 
                        Here are some simple C++ code examples to help you understand the language:
                        1.Hello World
                        #include <iostream>
                        int main() {
                            std::cout << "Hello, World!" << std::endl;
                            return 0;
                        }
                        Output
                        Hello, World!
                </div>
                <div class="item" id="item_2">

                        Performance: C++ is a compiled language, which means that its code is compiled into machine-readable code,
                         making it one of the fastest programming languages.Object-Oriented Programming: C++ supports object-oriented programming, which makes it easier to write and maintain large, complex applications.
                        Standard Template Library (STL): The STL provides a wide range of algorithms and data structures for working with data, making it easier to write efficient and effective code.
                        Machine Independent: C++ is not tied to any hardware or processor. If the compiler compiles the program in the system, it will be able to run no matter what the hardware is.

                        user requests for a web page, the server sends back the requested page. The Web server typically 
                        passes the form information to a small application program that processes the data and may send back a
